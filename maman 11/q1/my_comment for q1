hi Dani.
At leason 4 you actually solved q1. all i needed to add is the function atoi().
If i would present to you this sulotion, it would prove 2 things.
The first is that i'v watched you leason, and the second is that i know how to copy.
So i try to do a diffrent sulotion. i hope you would appritiate it.
